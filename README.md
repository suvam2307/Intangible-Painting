# Intangible-Painting
It is a python open CV project where we made a soft  system it dectects  our hand movements and help us to write anything in the screen and can draw the shape directly like circle and squares and curve lines and stright lines.
PLEASE NOTE:- It will only work with the python 3.7 interpretor.
